Created by Jacob Ellington & Ansel Chang

## Repo status
TL;DR: you're better off just creating a new vivado project and importing the source files than trying to get vivado to open this repo.


This repo is honestly really borked. The source files are valid but all Vivado data is garbage as the project was created in a newer version than is available on WPI servers and then my laptop broke and I didn't want to totally re-do this repo. the project xpr file has been outright deleted since it is so woefully out of date.

## Progress
HID: Complete
Keyboard Wrapper: Complete

Important TODO: impliment thousands in bin2BCD
